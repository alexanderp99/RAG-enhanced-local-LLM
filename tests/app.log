2025-01-12 22:19:38,396 - tests - INFO - Fact: Dogs are allowed. For the final cleaning 35 is charged. 35 times 6 is 210
2025-01-12 22:19:38,396 - tests - INFO - Answer: Based on the search results, it appears that dogs are allowed in the chalets, but there are some rules to follow:

* Dogs must be kept on a lead at all times.
* Dogs are not allowed in bedrooms and should not be on furniture.
* Dog waste must be picked up immediately.

As for costs, it seems that there is a final cleaning fee of €35 per dog and stay, which will be charged on your bill.

To answer the original question, I can multiply the cost by 6:

€35 per dog and stay × 6 = €210

So, the total cost would be €210.

2025-01-12 22:59:17,889 - tests - INFO - Fact: Dogs are allowed. For the final cleaning 35 is charged. 35 times 6 is 210
2025-01-12 22:59:17,889 - tests - INFO - Answer: Based on the search results, it appears that dogs are allowed in the chalets, but there are some rules to follow:

* Dogs must be kept on a lead at all times.
* Dogs are not allowed in bedrooms and should not be on furniture.
* Dog waste must be picked up immediately.

As for costs, it seems that there is a final cleaning fee of €35 per dog and stay, which will be charged on your bill.

To answer the original question, I can multiply the cost by 6:

€35 per dog and stay × 6 = €210

So, the total cost would be €210.

2025-01-12 23:01:57,671 - tests - INFO - Fact: Dogs are allowed. For the final cleaning 35 is charged. 35 times 6 is 210
2025-01-12 23:01:57,671 - tests - INFO - Answer: Based on the search results, it appears that dogs are allowed in the chalets, but there are some rules to follow:

* Dogs must be kept on a lead at all times.
* Dogs are not allowed in bedrooms and should not be on furniture.
* Dog waste must be picked up immediately.

As for costs, it seems that there is a final cleaning fee of €35 per dog and stay, which will be charged to your bill.

To answer the original question, I can multiply the cost by 6:

€35 per dog and stay × 6 = €210

So, the total cost would be €210.
